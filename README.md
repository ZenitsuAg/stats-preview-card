## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile first workflow
- Vanilla CSS

### What I learned

I learned CSS positioning, Grid and media queries to be able to get this project to this stage.

### Continued development

I'm gonna still do more work on CSS Grid and media queries, there's a lot that can be achieved there and I'll also learn flexbox because I'm planning to pick an even more difficult project next.
